Figure 4-1 (GARD Guide) provides a characterisation road map. 

For this asset development stage, leading practice focuses on question 1 “Is ARD/ML likely to occur?” Geochemical characterisation activities aim to identify potential ARD/ML risks. Characterisation activities for ARD/ML usually piggyback on exploration sampling and assaying activities (which focus on resource delineation) and can include:
(1) Review of existing geological information or information from analogue sites or geoenvironmental models for similar ore types
(2) Inclusion of ARD/ML diagnostic parameters such as total sulphur and inorganic carbon in exploration assays",(1) Should ARD/ML risks be assessed and how?,"Early identification of potential ARD/ML risks associated with a potential ore deposit allows for informed consideration of ARD/ML risks in asset development and early economic evaluation, and the development of informed objectives for the asset.

12,Design,ARD/ML governance and strategy,Define ARD/ML Governance and Strategy at Corporate Level,"ARD/ML governance and strategy is defined at the corporate level and is influenced by three main factors: 
(1) Community Guidance - every asset is established within a community that includes all interested and affected parties (eg immediate neighbours; local, regional and national communities; and global non-governmental organizations). Local communities are the most directly affected by an asset. They are highly influential, have real and perceived rights, and often have the most complex needs. Communities can grant/withdraw the social privilege to operate and corporate governance should consider the challenges, risks, and opportunities related to community engagement.
(2) Industry Guidance - although mining companies are not obligated to comply with global industry guidance unless it is a condition of funding, it is considered leading practice to adhere to such guidance unless it conflicts with regulations or other mandatory requirements. Global guidance provided by organizations such as ICMM, INAP, the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation, the World Health Organization (to name a few) is robust and covers technical subjects from material characterisation through ARD/ML prevention, mitigation, across all asset development stages including closure. 
(3) Regulatory or Financial Requirements - mining companies, irrespective of size, must adhere to the national, regional, and local legislation and regulations of the jurisdictions where they operate. In most regulatory regimes, mining proponents are required at an early stage to address potential environmental risks (including ARD/ML) through an environmental impact study and subsequently through environmental management plans and closure plans. See GARD Guide chapter 3, section 3.5. In addition, mining companies may be required to disclose sustainability information to investors, securities commissions, and other stakeholders.

Responsible corporate ARD/ML governance and strategy will balance the minimum requirements for the company to operate with the company's alignment with sustainability practices.","(1) Are company ARD/ML-related risk tolerances appropriately defined based on environmental commitments, the views of its stakeholders, and the jurisdictions in which it operates?
(2) Are implementation strategies for leading practices appropriately defined to meet/exceed the company's ARD/ML vision and uphold its reputation?","A company can only operate at an asset level, and obtain access to new resources, if it obtains, and keeps, its privilege to operate through implementation of Leading practices. The privilege to operate is typically defined by the local communities and the regulatory landscapes in which the company operates. ","(1) Jurisdictions of all company assets
(2) Applicable regulatory requirements
(3) Global guidelines
(4) Corporate policies, including commitments to sustainability principles
(5) Needs, concerns, and expectations of local, national, and global communities relevant to company activities","Considerations when setting the ARD/ML strategy include:
(1) Community needs may change with time, asset development stage, and socioeconomic status. Therefore, it is imperative to remain aware of the changing conditions at assets and feedback should be fed back to corporate.
(2) Corporate guidelines should represent the company’s view of the priorities to be addressed and their interpretation of generally accepted leading practice. 
(3) Companies often makes corporate commitments regarding ARD/ML that form the foundation of the social privilege to operate. Should an asset fail to meet its commitments, this privilege can be placed at risk. While ARD/ML issues generally are of a highly technical nature, the adverse consequences of getting it wrong can be material.
(4) There is, therefore, no one size fits all approach to address ARD/ML management and the strategy set at the corporate level must consider that ARD/ML management is to be implemented in recognition of the unique social, economic, and environmental situation of each asset.
(5) ARD/ML corporate guidance can include, among others: (a) corporate charter with commitments on performance and consultation, (b) commitments to external sustainability principles and metrics, (c) public targets for environmental, social and closure performance, (d) quantitative and prescriptive performance criteria, (e) risk assessment protocols and methodologies to develop asset-specific performance criteria, and (f) technical guidelines with methodologies to follow for assessment, design, and evaluation of water quality and ARD/ML.
(6) It is increasingly common to ascribe to the principle that the practices in the home country of the company (ie company headquarters location) should be considered where they are more stringent than the local requirements (ie an asset's location). Corporate governance related to environmental performance should not be compromised based on a geographical location. Moreover, non-governmental organizations, financing institutions, and other stakeholders judge performance based on the company as whole and not on individual locations. 
(7) The corporate strategy should identify the functions responsible and accountable across the business (asset and corporate) for implementation of ARD/ML management, monitoring and assessing performance, and engaging if/when implementation of additional prevention or mitigation measures is required.

(2) Mine (environmental) permitting
(3) Characterisation of baseline conditions

The ARD/ML potential of materials either disturbed or produced by the asset defines the type of drainage that will be generated, which in turn determines the ARD/ML prevention and mitigation measures to be considered in the mine plan and the facility designs. ARD/ML prevention is the key to avoid costly mitigation. Prevention of ARD/ML can be achieved through a risk-based planning and design approach that is applied throughout the life of the asset. Prevention is primarily accomplished in the design stage, with more options and more effective options available earlier in the life of the asset. Effective geochemical characterisation programs lead to better estimations of drainage chemistry, enabling more confident and appropriate selection of ARD/ML prevention measures (eg selection of lower cost, lower risk measures via trade-off studies).

(5) Corporate characterisation guidelines/requirements
(6) Applicable regulatory requirements","All materials to be disturbed or produced by the asset require ARD/ML evaluation. The level of required data for each material type is determined by the life of asset mass of material, its compositional variability, its anticipated ARD/ML potential, and the proposed management of the material (stored, used, processed). All data generated should be made available in a digital format and asset geochemical database and documented in the ARD/ML management plan. 

Considerations to determine the required data:
(1) Geochemical characterisation programs are typically conducted in phases; confirm pre-existing information including from analogue sites, exploration data, geo-environmental models etc.
(2) Sample selection (GARD Guide section 4.3.2.1). Ensure samples represent each material type (and individual lithologies for waste rocks) and that sample populations are spatially and compositionally representative.
(3) Analyses (GARD Guide section 4.3.2.3). Static testing typically includes acid base accounting (ABA), solid phase geochemistry, short-term leach testing and mineralogical analysis. Kinetic testing of at least 1 to 2 representative samples of waste rock and tailings materials is recommended. All testing must include quality assurance/quality control samples.
(4) Sample numbers (GARD Guide section 4.3.2.2). Static testing can require collection and analysis of several hundred representative samples (dependent on life of asset mass of material, its compositional variability, its anticipated ARD/ML potential and the proposed management of the material). In general, the larger the mass of material, variability, and ARD/ML potential, the more extensive the required geochemical characterisation program.

15,Design,Develop and refine ARD/ML management plan,Prediction,"A prediction program for drainage chemistry is a critical part of mine planning and informs water and mine waste management and integrated closure planning. Its primary objective is to evaluate the ARD/ML potential of geologic materials and mine and process wastes, and their likelihood to affect the environment (in particular, water resources). The secondary objectives of a prediction program can include defining prevention methods, selecting mitigation methods, assessing potential water quality impact.

Drainage chemistry from mine and process wastes is determined by their geochemical and physical properties, the mine waste facility design (including material and water management strategies), and site-specific climate conditions. Predicted drainage chemistries are used to determine the need for, and nature of, ARD/ML prevention, mitigation, and treatment measures.

Prediction efforts peak during Design, with the prediction of drainage chemistry supporting the assessment of the economic viability of the asset. Additional activities that are typically supported by prediction programs include:
(1) Development of mine plan, mine waste and mine water and ARD/ML management plans
(2) Mine (environmental) permitting
(3) Characterisation of baseline conditions
(4) Pre-feasibility and feasibility studies

(2) Prediction efforts usually peak during the pre-feasibility study.
(3) During the feasibility study, the aim is to refine previous predictions; reduce the envelope of uncertainty; and incorporate additional geochemical data, refined facility designs, and updated water and waste management concepts.
(4) During detailed design, prediction is usually limited but could include evaluation of key ARD/ML risks/uncertainties identified during the feasibility study. ","(1) Are the rationales and purposes of drainage chemistry predictions defined?
(2) Are the required types and levels of drainage chemistry predictions defined for operational, closure and post closure asset development stages?","Design stage drainage chemistry predictions must be sufficiently robust to allow estimation of any significant long-term costs of ARD/ML management for inclusion in the economic evaluation of the asset. In general, more mine water, mine waste management and closure options, and more effective options, are available earlier in the life of the asset, making ARD/ML prediction during design a critical activity. 

ARD/ML prevention is the key to avoid costly mitigation. Prevention of ARD/ML can be achieved through a risk-based planning and design approach that is applied throughout the life of the asset.

(9) Water quality information from analogue sites or geoenvironmental models for similar deposits","Drainage chemistry predictions are required for all mine contact water and typically include runoff water, seepage/process return water, and contact water from management infrastructure. Predictions should be for all individual mine infrastructure, and at an asset-wide level (eg the water quality model). Drainage chemistry predictions for mine infrastructure typically require: (1) Facility-level designs (conceptual at a minimum), (2) the ARD/ML properties of disturbed/processed materials, and (3) facility-level water balance model.

Asset-wide drainage chemistry predictions are based on a water management strategy/concept for the management and use of mine contact water. Drainage chemistry predictions are typically provided as inputs to surface/groundwater models used to evaluate effects in the downstream receiving environments. Drainage chemistry predictions need to be coordinated with respect to detail, content, and schedule with the aforementioned modelling activities. Considerations to determining drainage chemistry predictions:
(1) Drainage chemistry can be predicted by (a) conducting lab/field leachability tests, (b) geochemical modelling, and/or (c) using relevant water quality monitoring data (historic asset or analogue site data).
(2) Drainage chemistry prediction is an iterative process during design as material characterisation data are produced, designs are progressed, and water/waste/closure management strategies are created. See GARD Guide Figure 5-1 for activities to support prediction during design and GARD Guide Figure 5-2 for a flow chart of the iterative process.
(3) Drainage chemistry prediction needs are similar for Feasibility Study and environmental assessment/permitting. The transition between the two study stages is often rapid or they occur in parallel. Drainage predictions are used as input to surface and groundwater assessments/models to assess environmental (water quality) effects on site-specific receptors.
(4) The level of drainage chemistry prediction is a function of the ARD/ML potential of disturbed/processed materials. A more detailed evaluation is required where ARD/ML risks are higher and more costly prevention/mitigation measures may be required. 
(5) Drainage chemistry predictions are inherently uncertain. It is essential to document sources of uncertainty and develop an envelope of results that is reflective of the uncertainties in input parameters, bounding arguments, and assumptions. 

All data and information generated by prediction activities should be made available in a digital format, included (consolidated) and properly referenced in the ARD/ML management plan.","(1) Develop and refine ARD/ML management plan → All leading practice activities

16,Design,Develop and refine ARD/ML management plan,"Prevention, Mitigation, and Treatment","Early avoidance of ARD/ML issues is a leading practice that may be achieved through integrating the characterisation and prediction results with mine planning, design, water, waste, and closure management strategies. Avoidance is not synonymous with non-development in mining; rather, it includes the decision not to extract a reactive rock types that will be too difficult to manage in the future (e.g. develop mine designs that avoid or work around difficult rock types).

Prevention is a proactive strategy that removes the need for the reactive approach to mitigation and also has the potential to remove long term post closure liability. Mitigation will be the usual initial course of action for an existing case of mine drainage that is adversely impacting the environment. Subsequent preventative measures may also need to be considered in the context of reducing future contaminant load, and thus reducing the ongoing need for mitigation controls. During the design stage, the focus should be on prevention. The goal of mitigation measures is to maintain or control the rate of sulphide mineral oxidation so that ARD/ML formation is prevented or reduced to minimal or acceptable levels. Treatment of drainage may be required to satisfy environmental objectives and can be achieved through a variety of methods. Mine drainage treatment projects are executed within the overall hierarchy of mine water management. Active long-term post closure operation and maintenance of mine drainage treatment facilities may be less desirable due to the potentially significant ongoing associated liabilities. Passive treatment technologies are, therefore, considered more beneficial in post closure than active treatment technologies, where applicable

The ARD/ML management plan must consider prevention, mitigation, and treatment. The science and engineering of ARD/ML prevention and mitigation are evolving. There are no off-the-shelf solutions that can be applied at all sites that will guarantee acceptable water quality through prevention of ARD/ML. Therefore, the planning for and management of mine material handling and storage should be considered in a risk-based framework that considers risk across all asset development stages.

The implementation of methods for prevention and mitigation depends on many factors, including the mine development stage, deposit type, geochemistry, climatic regime, terrain (or topography), surface water, geology, groundwater, and aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Material availability, land management and land use requirements, receptors, risk, cost, maintenance, sustainability, and regulatory requirements will also influence the approach selected.","(1) Are strategic objectives for preventing and mitigating ARD/ML risks defined for all asset development stages?
(2) Are prevention and mitigation measures aimed at meeting strategic objectives incorporated into mine infrastructure designs?","ARD/ML prevention is the key to avoid costly mitigation. Prevention of ARD/ML can be achieved through a risk-based planning and design approach that is applied throughout the life of asset. Prevention is primarily accomplished in the design stage, with more options and more effective options available earlier in the asset life.","(1) Mine plan, including the integrated closure plan if available

(4) Results from prediction of drainage chemistry
(5) Company drainage prediction guidelines/requirements
(6) Applicable regulatory guidelines
(7) Risk acceptance by company and stakeholders","For both prevention and mitigation, the strategic objectives define the control methods required. The process of identifying the strategic objectives should consider: (1) Quantifiable risks to ecological systems, human health, and other receptors; (2) Site-specific discharge water quality criteria; (3) Capital, operating, and maintenance costs of mitigation or preventative measures; (4) Logistics of long-term operations and maintenance; (5) Required system longevity; and (6) Risk of system failure and identification of potential modes of failure

The principal approach to the prevention and mitigation of ARD/ML is to apply methods that minimise the supply of the primary reactants for sulphide oxidation, and/or maximise the amount and availability of acid neutralising reactants. These methods may involve one or more of the following: (1) Minimising oxygen supply; (2) Minimising water infiltration and leaching (water acts as both a reactant and a transport mechanism); (3) Minimising, removing, or isolating sulphide minerals; (4) Controlling pore water solution pH; (5) Maximising availability of acid neutralising minerals and pore water alkalinity; and (6) Controlling bacteria and biogeochemical processes

A typical objective for ARD/ML control is to satisfy environmental criteria using the most cost-effective technique. In general, more options and more effective options are available earlier in the life of asset, when pH may be near neutral and oxidation products have not significantly accumulated. One measure, or a combination of measures, may be required to achieve the desired objective. Design of prevention and mitigation measures and treatment will require analytical/numerical modelling to predict both geochemical and physical performance. The time frame and scheduling of the implementation of control measures becomes important when potentially acid generating/forming materials have a limited predicted time to the onset of ARD production.

Where avoidance and prevention are not possible, post closure water treatment system land requirements should be considered in the design of tailings storage and waste rock facilities so that space is available, when needed, and post closure water treatment does not become a major design constraint that forces the implementation of active treatment technologies. Post closure water treatment has material closure liability implications and should only be considered after all other potential mitigation strategies have been evaluated and deemed insufficient. During the design stage, the ARD/ML management plan describes the anticipated prevention, mitigation and treatment required throughout the life of asset.

Monitoring occurs at all asset stages; however, the objectives, components, and intensity of the monitoring activities will change, and the description in the ARD/ML management plan is refined accordingly. Because there may be a lag time to the onset of ARD/ML, prudent environmental management includes an ongoing assessment of the potential for the development of ARD/ML, or the degree to which ARD/ML generation has been realised at this point in time.

18,Design,Develop and refine ARD/ML management plan,"Development and Integration with Mine, Water, Waste, and Closure Plans","The need to develop a formal ARD/ML management plan during the design stage is usually triggered by the results of a characterisation and prediction program (GARD Guide chapters 4 and 5) or the results of site monitoring (chapter 8). Formal ARD/ML management plans are typically required for assets where ARD/ML has been identified as an issue (at a scale where prevention/mitigation/management influences the economic viability of the asset). 

Where ARD/ML has been identified as an issue, ARD/ML management plans have the following objectives:
(1) To consolidate and be a repository of all ARD/ML data, information, measures and commitments associated with the project or mine site.
(2) To act as a reference for ARD/ML components of related management and monitoring plans, including environmental management plans, mine waste management plans, mine water management plans, monitoring plans and closure plans.
(3) To be a dynamic document that is updated as required and as projects and mine sites progresses through the stages to retain information and institutional knowledge.","(1) Is an ARD/ML management plan required?
(2) Are the structure and content of the ARD/ML management plan defined?
(3) Are the independencies between the ARD/ML management plan and other management plans, including but not necessarily limited to, mine plans, environmental plans, monitoring plans, mine waste and mine water management plans, closure plans, and social engagement plans, identified and described?","The need for an ARD/ML management plan is established during the design stage. Such plans require resources to develop and maintain in subsequence stages. ARD/ML management plans also create efficiencies for future ARD/ML assessments, operationalisation of ARD/ML management practices, closure planning and communication with internal and external stakeholders. ","Developing an ARD/ML management plan should be considered if there is a reasonable expectation (based, for instance, on data from analogue sites, characterisation and prediction studies) that contact water will be impacted by mining activities to a degree that concentrations of constituents of potential concern will likely exceed regulated water quality limits and/or require ARD/ML mitigation and prevention measures. 

The comprehensiveness of the ARD/ML management plan can be variable depending on the nature and magnitude of the ARD/ML risks and associated prevention/mitigation measures. Active management of mine water (for the purposes of ARD/ML mitigation) typically requires the most comprehensive ARD/ML management plan.

(2) Relevant ARD/ML prediction studies
(3) ARD/ML prevention and mitigation strategies 
(4) Company policies, standards, and guidelines related to ARD/ML management
(5) Outcomes of environmental effects assessments and environmental risk assessments
(6) Applicable regulatory requirements","ARD/ML management plans typically include the following content related to ARD/ML management:
(1) Reference to relevant company policies/standards/operating procedures/KPIs 
(2) Concise project description with specific reference to mine layout, mine infrastructure and materials that will be disturbed and/or generated from the project across all asset development stages.
(3) Summary of material characterisation studies conducted during the relevant design stages (pre-feasibility study, feasibility study, detailed design)
(4) Summary of prediction studies (facility-level as well as site-wide)
(5) Description of ARD/ML strategies for mine infrastructure, mine operations and closure.
(6) Description of operational controls during subsequent stages (standard operating procedures, KPIs, quality assurance/quality control). Operational controls should also define requirements for ARD/ML data management, evaluation and reporting, and be specific to each asset development stage
(7) Defined roles and assigned responsibility and accountability
(8) Description of ARD/ML monitoring and performance assessment requirements.

ARD/ML management plans are a compilation of and consolidate ARD/ML related study data, information, strategies, requirements, and commitments that are usually distributed across multiple studies and documents, over multiple stages. Having this information in one place is invaluable for efficient progression of ARD/ML studies, optimisation/adjustment of operational ARD/ML management practices, and integrated closure. 

All ARD/ML data and information should be made available in a digital format for inclusion in the ARD/ML management plan. It is essential that all functions responsible for ARD/ML planning, mine planning, mine waste and water management planning, closure planning, and social engagement communicate on a regular basis and develop a record of topics discussed, decisions made, required actions, and responsible/accountable parties for execution of those actions.

22,Design,Integrated closure,Integrated Closure,"The prediction, prevention, and management of ARD/ML is a critical component of closure planning for any asset where there is a potential for the generation of ARD/ML. Expending additional resources early in the life of asset to collect materials characterisation and baseline data, and model ARD/ML issues to support credible projections of long-term closure implications allows the development of an optimised mine design, ideally with a focus on ARD/ML avoidance and prevention rather than relying on mitigation or treatment at closure.

The concept of “design for closure” should be applied in the design of all mine and process facilities that have an ARD/ML potential. Design for closure requires that the full life of asset be considered in the design of the mine components so that the desired mine closure conditions are achieved as part of operations rather than as closure solutions executed when there are no operational synergies or mine revenue. Implementing the “design for closure” approach for ARD/ML is achieved by integrating closure planning with ARD/ML management planning and mine planning. While the characterisation and predictions for ARD/ML will be refined over the life of the asset, there is an imperative to start identification of the nature and extent (spatial and temporal) of any ARD/ML issues as early as practicable.

Like ARD/ML management plans, closure plans are also developed iteratively, with increasing levels of detail and reduced uncertainty over the life of the asset. ARD/ML management plans should be prepared and implemented, integrating the requirements for progressive (concurrent) and final mine closure.",(1) Are mechanisms identified and documented for ARD/ML leading practice areas and activities that integrate closure and post closure requirements and support the early stages of closure planning?,"Ideally, it should be known at the earliest stages of mine planning if there will be need for significant ARD/ML mitigation works throughout the life of asset. Avoidance and prevention should be the focus. Where closure management and / or ongoing treatment are identified, the risks associated with these activities, the high level of uncertainty and potential for changing expectations, as well as ongoing cost profile should be fully assessed against other mitigations measures that require active involvement. The design stage represents the most opportune stage for identification of the nature and extent of any ARD/ML issues. Where there is a potential for ARD/ML, a key element of integrated closure planning is to incorporate measures to prevent that potential from being realised from the beginning. ","(1) Results from geochemical characterisation program 
(2) Results from prediction of drainage chemistry
(3) Company drainage prediction guidelines/requirements
(4) Company closure guidelines/requirements
(5) Applicable regulatory guidelines
(6) Risk acceptance by company and stakeholders","Key approaches when implementing the “design for closure” concept include:
(1) Adapt the design of the mine’s components, to the extent practical, to accommodate efficient and durable operational management measures that do not result in ongoing closure liabilities. 
(2) Avoid designs that result in unacceptable post-mining land capabilities and uses and/or impractical or costly closure implementation and/or require extensive and prolonged post closure care. 
(3) Avoid designs that unnecessarily increase the liability associated with the asset during the post closure period.
(4) Maximise the potential for progressive mine closure during operations as this both reduces the cost of closure, and also allows the performance of closure measures relevant to ARD/ML management to be assessed and improved as necessary. This also has the benefit of reducing closure liability. 

Integrated closure planning initially considers a range of feasible and integrated mine and closure alternatives, which are progressively eliminated until preferred options are selected that, on balance, best achieve the closure objectives and requirements. Even at early stages, it is necessary to identify an option that will be used as the basis for closure planning and cost estimations. Closure designs should be established at the level applicable to regulatory and company requirements while also providing sufficient understanding of their ability to manage ARD/ML impacts and meet the required KPIs and closure objectives identified in the ARD/ML management plan. 

Common closure activities related to ARD/ML management include:
(1) Flooding of open pits and underground workings (either actively or passively after the cessation of dewatering activities) so that exposed potentially acid generating/forming material is resubmerged as soon as possible.
(2) Resloping/reshaping or other stabilising activities (eg armouring) to achieve long-term geotechnically stable configurations and/or facilitate cover placement, with the objective to minimise potential re-exposure of potentially acid generating/forming material.
(3) Cover placement over mine wastes to limit contact water and/or ingress of oxygen.
(4) Reconfiguration of surface water management landforms to direct non-contact water away from reactive material.
(5) Construction or modification of water treatment facilities, as an ongoing management option.","(1) Develop and refine ARD/ML management plan → Characterisation

An adaptive management plan is developed that describes the uncertainty to be addressed, the process/activities/timeline to address the uncertainty and fulfil the defined objectives of the ARD/ML management plan, the monitoring requirements, and the reporting process. 

In the context of ARD/ML management, adaptive management/continual improvement is the process of using learnings and outcomes as a means to reduce uncertainties and improve management practices for ARD/ML over all asset stages. Since it is not practical to wait years or decades to confirm successful performance of waste management methods, adaptive management techniques are needed to respond to unexpected developments while maintaining environmental protection and cost control. GARD Guide Figure 6-4 illustrates adaptive management and implementation using a phased approach, which starts with the development of hypotheses and conceptual designs based on site characterisation and problem definition. The phased process can begin at any stage of asset development. The key step is to develop a system design that leads to a basis for ongoing evaluation of site conditions, the capacity to make decisions, implement improvements in system design, and verification of the performance of these designs. Regional and local experience at nearby mines, where available, should be used to minimise redundant investigations and to optimise the most successful methods for prevention and control.

The execution of these activities requires appropriate allocation of responsibilities for these tasks. The asset’s general manager is ultimately accountable for the implementation of the ARD/ML management plan. Mine or mill managers are typically responsible for the implementation of the ARD/ML management plan. Monitoring activities can be incorporated in broader environmental or geological monitoring programs with appropriate accountability assigned. ARD/ML related monitoring activities require standard operating procedures.

Geochemical verification (quality assurance/quality control) activities related to mine waste (tailings, waste rock, process wastes) production are typically captured in the design specifications and/or standard operating procedures for these activities. Responsibility for these tasks is assigned to the relevant department with appropriate accountability assigned. Tasks can be performed by suitably qualified internal staff or external contractors/consultants.

Reviews/audits of the ARD/ML management plan typically occur during the operations stage. This could include evaluating field data and assessing performance against the plan objectives, interpreting the data, and linking data from the construction activities (eg comparing mine dispatch data on segregation of waste rock against seep survey data from the dump or evaluating geochemical suitability of construction materials). Where required, evaluation should be completed be an appropriately qualified scientist/engineer with practical experience across relevant disciplines to ensure that the ARD/ML management issues relevant to the mining and process operation are understood directly at the asset level.

Various ARD/ML related assessments, including responding to changes in the mine plan (requiring additional characterisation, prediction, prevention and mitigation), the optimisation of mine water and mine waste management strategies, evaluation of ARD/ML related closure measures and updating of post closure drainage chemistry predictions, take place during the operations stage.

(4) Seepage water quality from waste rock piles or in groundwater quality 
(5) Treated water discharge qualities compared with treatment quality objectives
(6) Observed versus predicted time histories, for instance for evolution of water qualities 

Any such deviations/variances indicate a need for recalibration of predictive models and reassessment of control measures effectiveness and requirements to meet the long-term objectives of the ARD/ML management plan. Indicators used for monitoring environmental impacts are typically a measure of quantity and quality of the natural resources and biota over and downstream of sources/deposits (eg vegetation and biota species abundance, surface water/groundwater quality in the receiving environment).

ARD/ML data and information obtained during the operations stage need to be compiled in a systematic manner in an electronic repository accessible to all functions involved with ARD/ML management. A record should be kept of formal discussions of ARD/ML related topics, decisions made, required actions, and responsible/accountable parties for execution of those actions. Data management procedures should include standard recordkeeping procedures, document control, and the approach for electronic storage and retrieval. Ongoing data evaluation is required to assess data quality and provide feedback to environmental management systems (eg evaluation of water quality trends to identify the onset of ARD/ML or the need for modifications of sample locations, frequencies or analytical parameters).

To enable the rapid assessment of implementation and performance of ARD/ML management measures, trigger values should be established for ‘alerts’ and ‘response’ actions. When an ‘alert’ value is reached during monitoring, an increased level of monitoring and assessment is triggered. When a ‘response’ value is reached, the required assessment and response actions (eg contingency measures) should be initiated.","(1) ARD/ML objectives, standards, and KPIs → Set ARD/ML objectives, standards, and KPIs at asset level

Which constituents need to be removed by treatment? How long will treatment be needed? Is active or passive treatment required?). Similarly, adaptive management is frequently employed during operations to adjust practices related to ARD/ML management.

It is considered leading practice to implement progressive closure (aka concurrent closure) where practical. Progressive closure is the implementation of closure works during the operations Stage. For example, (portions of) waste rock facilities or tailings impoundments may be partially or fully closed with covers placed while other facilities are still in operation. Similarly, (portions of) open pits and underground workings may be backfilled with mine waste. As needed, and on an incremental basis, detailed (construction) level designs are developed during operations for any progressive closure activities. In addition to reducing the overall closure liability for the asset, this provides a practical way to evaluate performance and refine the technologies that will be applied in the final closure. Progressive closure requires a degree of certainty around closure actions to be undertaken for a particular mine landform or facility. Hence, having a clear understanding of closure options, including source control, available to mitigate ARD/ML early in the life of the asset and advancing the options selection process is essential to being able to successfully implement progressive closure activities.","(1) Develop and refine ARD/ML management plan → Characterisation

64,Post-Closure,Monitor and assess performance,Transparency in Data Management and Reporting,"Monitoring for potential ARD/ML effects typically continues well into the post closure stage because ARD/ML cannot become evident until after a considerable latent or lag period. Longer-term monitoring is frequently associated with the presence of ARD/ML-generating materials. Post closure monitoring is performed to assess the performance of the closure design in meeting to the defined closure objectives and to demonstrate the geochemical stability of the mine wastes in the long term. Post closure monitoring may also be used to indicate the need for maintenance to be conducted on the site (eg cover repair). All post closure monitoring activities should be leveraged to identify maintenance needs.

The success of a mine closure is determined in the post closure stage, in the years to decades after completing the closure works. For assets with potential ARD/ML issues, this is also the time frame over which these issues may become apparent. At the very highest level of durable mine closure planning, closure goals are set for the post closure nature of the site, including environmental targets. In the case of ARD/ML, where acid generation and its impacts may take years or decades to become evident, defining an appropriate temporal component of these success criteria is critical. Success criteria and associated monitoring, particularly related to water quality, may be in place for decades. Understanding whether the asset is on a trajectory toward meeting the closure objectives is of great value and allows for the adjustment of mitigation measures or monitoring, as necessary.

Some parameters may be monitored for a relatively short period of time, until it can be demonstrated that closure success criteria have been met and are durable, or that the concentrations are on a trajectory towards meeting the success criteria.
